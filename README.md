# Bit-Earth Labs: Proof-of-Energy zkBTC-E System

> **Bitcoin-Authored Implementation** | *Transforming Energy into Bitcoin-Native Value*

## 🚀 Overview

Bit-Earth Labs implements a decentralized Proof-of-Energy (PoE) protocol that tokenizes verifiable renewable energy generation as zkBTC-E tokens on BitcoinOS. Each zkBTC-E represents 1 MWh of proven clean energy and is backed by $70 in multi-chain digital assets.
